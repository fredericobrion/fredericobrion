# Hello, I'm Frederico 👋

## Full-Stack Engineer | TypeScript • Node.js • Next.js • AWS

## About
I work on a large-scale education platform with 5M+ registered users, building and evolving full-stack solutions using TypeScript, NestJS, and Next.js.

Over the past year, I have taken increasing ownership of technical decisions, contributing to microservices architecture, database modeling, and cloud-based integrations on AWS.

With a background in Civil Engineering, I bring analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, and professional maturity into software development.

I am particularly interested in scalable systems, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability.
